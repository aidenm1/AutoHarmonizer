# AutoHarmonizer
##COSMOS 2022 Music and Technology Final Project

The AutoHarmonizer is a program which is capable of creating accompaniment for a melody input by a user or a melody generated by itself. This accompaniment comes in the form of drums and chords.


When the AutoHarmonizer script is run, this is the GUI that is seen:

Within this GUI, there are a few different options: 
## Inversions
If you enable inversions, the program will utilize voice leading, which means the chords generated will be created in such a way that when played in a sequence, they fit better with each other.
If inversions are disabled, all chords will be generated in root position

## Drums
If drums is selected, a drum track will be generated in addition to the chord track. 
If drums are disabled, only chords will be generated

## Musical Variety
The level of Musical Variety a user selects will affect which chords are selected for the chord track.
If "None" is selected, the chords generated will be very simple. 
If "Some" is selected, the chords generated will be less simple, and take advantage of less common chords.
If "A Lot" is selected, the chords generated will be much more random, and will utilize less common chords. 

## Auto-Generate Melody
If Auto-Generate Melody is selected, then no file is required from the user. Instead, the program will ask the user the length of the melody they wish("Measures") and the key of the melody they wish("Musical Key"). The program will then generate a melody based on these parameters.
